The course can be divided into 10-12 sessions, each covering one or two topics. Each session can be designed to include a mix of lectures, hands-on exercises, and discussions to ensure that the students are engaged and understand the concepts thoroughly.

The course can be concluded with a final project where the students can build a sample Ansible project from scratch and deploy a sample application using Ansible. The instructor can provide feedback and guidance to help the students complete the project successfully.

Additionally, it may be beneficial to include guest speakers or case studies of organizations that have successfully implemented Ansible to showcase real-world use cases and best practices.
